## What is Anime Lens?
Anime Lens is designed to help users discover new anime and manga series based on their interests.

**Key Features:**
- Anime search using keywords or filters  
- View trending anime suggestions  
- Create and manage a personal watchlist  
- Post comments and join discussions in the community section  
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile browsers
